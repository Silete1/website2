ERPs fail when data entry becomes a second job. To make Odoo or any ERP stick, we wire it into the tools people already rely on.

For field teams, we stream GPS or telematics data directly into ERP jobs and maintenance logs. For sales and support, we surface WhatsApp threads so follow-ups are tracked without leaving the conversation. For finance, we build clean API bridges so invoices and receipts match on both sides.

These integrations keep a single source of truth without slowing anyone down — turning “another system” into a natural part of the day.
